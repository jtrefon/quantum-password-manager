# CI/CD Setup Summary

This document summarizes the complete CI/CD, deployment, and release setup that has been created for the Password Manager CLI application.

## ðŸš€ What Was Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull Requests
- **Features**:
  - Multi-Rust version testing (stable, beta, nightly)
  - Code formatting and linting checks
  - Security audits with cargo-audit
  - Code coverage reporting
  - Caching for faster builds

#### **Build & Release** (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Version tags (v*), Manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Cross-platform builds (Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM64)
  - Automated GitHub releases
  - crates.io publishing
  - Binary artifact creation and upload

#### **Security Scanning** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push, PR, Daily schedule
- **Features**:
  - Daily security audits
  - Dependency vulnerability checks
  - Code scanning with multiple tools
  - Snyk integration
  - GitLeaks for secret detection

#### **Dependency Updates** (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Weekly schedule, Manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Automated dependency updates
  - Security validation
  - Automated PR creation
  - Test verification

### 2. Development Tools

#### **Makefile**
- Common development tasks
- Build, test, and deployment commands
- Release automation
- Development workflow optimization

#### **Release Script** (`scripts/release.sh`)
- Automated release process
- Version management
- Git tag creation
- Cross-platform build triggering

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Setup Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd password_manager
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets** (in GitHub):
   - `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: For crates.io publishing
   - `SNYK_TOKEN`: For security scanning (optional)

3. **Enable Actions**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
   - Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Install development tools
make setup

# Run tests
make test

# Build release
make release

# Security audit
make security

# Format code
make format

# Quick development cycle
make dev
```

### Release Process

```bash
# Automated release
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

# Or manual process
make release-create
```

### Installation Methods

```bash
# From source
cargo install --path .

# From crates.io (after publishing)
cargo install password_manager

# From GitHub releases
# Download binary for your platform and add to PATH
```
