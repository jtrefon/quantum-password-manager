# Password Manager Roadmap

[Existing content remains unchanged]

### M8 — Code Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Implement specific error types for security operations
- [ ] Reduce code duplication in encryption/decryption flows
- [ ] Apply builder pattern for complex object creation
- [ ] Add integration tests for full CLI workflows
- [ ] Implement fuzz testing for input validation
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for cryptographic operations
- [ ] Create automated release workflows in CI/CD

### M9 — Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement database indexing for faster search operations
- [ ] Add lazy loading support for large databases
- [ ] Explore memory-mapped files for large dataset handling
- [ ] Optimize Argon2 parameters for different hardware profiles
- [ ] Add configuration options for performance/security tradeoffs

### Updates to M6 — UX Polish and Docs
- [ ] Add configuration file support for persistent settings
- [ ] Implement interactive CLI with tab completion
- [ ] Add export/import formats for common password managers
- [ ] Make clipboard timeout configurable
- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable solutions

## Updated Issue Breakdown
- [ ] Security: Implement specific error types (SecurityError enum)
- [ ] Performance: Database indexing implementation
- [ ] UX: Add config file support (config.toml)
- [ ] Testing: Add integration test framework
- [ ] CI/CD: Implement automated release workflows
- [ ] CLI: Add interactive mode with tab completion
- [ ] Crypto: Memory-mapped file encryption/decryption
- [ ] Docs: Update SECURITY.md with new error handling
